    agency_name VARCHAR(50),
    reputation_level INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    missions_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Training certifications
CREATE TABLE player_certifications (
    player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id),
    certification_id VARCHAR(50),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    score INTEGER
);

-- Guild system
CREATE TABLE guilds (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

## 7. Conclusion

Integrating NITE Team 4's features into AI Idle Hacker presents significant opportunities to differentiate our game in the idle genre while maintaining our core progression mechanics. The Training Academy and Intelligence Agency Bounty systems offer the highest value-to-complexity ratio and should be prioritized for initial implementation.

The voice-acted campaigns and community features represent major undertakings that could transform the game experience but require substantial investment. The open world mission system, while innovative, should be considered only after establishing the foundational systems.

By implementing these features in phases, we can gradually evolve AI Idle Hacker from a traditional idle game into a unique hybrid experience that combines automated progression with educational content, narrative depth, and community engagement.
